# Challenge Summary
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
- Find common values in 2 binary trees
- Write a function called `tree_intersection` that takes two binary trees as parameters.
- Using your Hashmap implementation as a part of your algorithm, return a set of values found in both trees.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

### **Big O :**

**Time Complexity : O(n) >> cause of using preOrder method to traverse through the trees**

**Space Complexity: O(n) >> cause of storing the intersection values inside array**
