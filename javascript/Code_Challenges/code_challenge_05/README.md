# Singly Linked List
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
A Singly linked list means that there is only one reference, and the reference points to the Next node in a linked list

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Implement a Linked List that  uses Singly linked nodes

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->


Big O Time --> O(n) --> because of looping through the nodes

Big O space --> O(1) --> because no more space is required

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Linked List -->

- insert
  - Arguments: value
  - Returns: nothing
  - Adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
- includes
  - Arguments: value
  - Returns: Boolean
  - Indicates whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.
- to string
  - Arguments: none
  - Returns: a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
"{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"
