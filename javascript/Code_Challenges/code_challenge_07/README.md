## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

The approach for this method was to start by looking at the head of the list, and then loop until to reach to end of list which has null value.Then traverse reverse until to reach Kth node then return the node value.

 - The time of this method is O(n) and the space is O(1).
